# Notes

## Step0: Code Gen Phase

  
## Step1: A minimal core language

- pattern matching: only `guard` is implemented.
- `let`: LHS must be a symbol or a symbol with type annotation
- type definition: Only `type a` is allowed, no `ADT` syntax.

Other language features and constructs are implemented.

P.S: It seems also a bit time-consuming.

We don't implement `open` statements now.
